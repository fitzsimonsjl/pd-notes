# Automate Azure tasks using scripts with PowerShell

Creating admin scrips is a great way to optimise your workflow - allowing you to automate common repetitive tasks.

Azure provides three administration tools:

- The Azure Portal

- The Azure CLI

- Azure PowerShell

Tehy all offer roughly the same amount of control and all are cross-platform between Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### What is the Azure Portal?

The Azure Portal is a website that lets you create, configure, and alter resources in your Azure subscription (a GUI)

### What is the Azure CLI?

The Azure CLI is a cross platform command-line program to connect to Azure and execute admin commands on Azure resources e.g for creating a new resource group:

```
az vm create \
  --resource-group CrmTestingResourceGroup \
  --name CrmUnitTests \
  --image UbuntuLTS
  ...
```

### What is Azure PowerShell?

It's a module you add to PowerShell to connect to your Azure subscription and manage resources e.g for creating a new VM:

```
az vm create \
  --resource-group CrmTestingResourceGroup \
  --name CrmUnitTests \
  --image UbuntuLTS
  ...
```

### Create an Azure Resource using scripts in Azure PowerShell

**PowerShell Cmdlets**

A PowerShell command is called a cmdlet - it manipulates a single feature. By convention, cmdlets should be simple and single-purpose.

They follow a verb-noun naming convention e.g. Get-Process, Format-Table or Start-Service. There is also convention for verb choice: "get" to retreive data, "set" to insert or update data, "format" to format data, and "out" to direct output

You can use "Get-Help" which will display a help file for each cmdlet (similar to man pages for Linux).

```
Get-Help -Name Get-ChildItem -Detailed
```

**PowerShell Modules**

Cmdlets are shipped in modules. A PowerShell module is a DLL that includes the code to process each available cmdlet. To get a list of loaded modules, use "Get-Module"

**The Az PowerShell module**

Az is hte formal name for the Azure PowerShell module which contains cmdlets to work with Azure features.

The Az PowerShell module is available from a global repository called the PowerShell Gallery. You can install it via the Install-Module cmdlet:

```
Install-Module -Name Az -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery
```

If the script execution fails, you'll need to change the execution policy:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

**Updating a PowerShell module**

If you get an error or warning that a version is already installed, you can update to the latest:

```
Update-Module -Name Az
```

**Creating a Resource Group with Azure PowerShell**

There are four steps:

- Import Azure cmdlets (done automatically)

- Connect to your Azure subscription (Connect-AzAccount)

- Create the Resource Group

- Verify creation was successful

**Working with subscriptions**

You can see which subscription is active with Get-AzContext. Get a list of them with Get-AzSubscription e.g:

```
Set-AzContext -Subscription '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
```

**Get a list of all resource groups**

```
Get-AzResourceGroup | Format-Table
```

**New Resource Group**

```
New-AzResourceGroup -Name <name> -Location <location>
```

**Verify Resources**

```
Get-AzResource | Format-Table
```

**Create an Azure VM**

```
New-AzVm
       -ResourceGroupName <resource group name>
       -Name <machine name>
       -Credential <credentials object>
       -Location <location>
       -Image <image name>
```

You can supply these params directly to the cmdlet (shown above) or use other cmdlets to configure the VM e.g. Set-AzVMOperatingSystem, Set-AzVMSourceImage or Add-AzVMNetworkInterface.

The AzVM sfufix is specific to VM-based commands in PowerShell:

| Command      | Description                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Remove-AzVM  | Deletes an Azure VM                |
| Start-AzVM   | Starts a stopped VM                |
| Stop-AzVM    | Stop a running VM                  |
| Restart-AzVM | Restart a VM                       |
| Update-AzVM  | Updates the configuration for a VM |

### Create and save scripts in Azure PowerShell

PowerShell files have a .ps1 ending - you can ceate and save them in any text editor. Once you've written and saved your script, execute it with ./<name-of-script>.ps1

**Variables**

Variables are written in the same way as BASH ($)

**Parameters**

When you execute a script you can pass arguments on the comand line e.g.

```
.\setupEnvironment.ps1 -size 5 -location "East US"
```

Inside the script itself you capture these values in variables (parameters are matched by name):

```
param([string]$location, [int]$size)
```
