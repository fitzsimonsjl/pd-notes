### AAD Concepts

| Azure AD concept             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identity**                 | An *identity* is an object that can be authenticated. The identity can be a user with a username and password. Identities can also be applications or other servers that require authentication by using secret keys or certificates. Azure AD is the underlying product that provides the identity service.                                                                              |
| **Account**                  | An *account* is an identity that has data associated with it. To have an account, you must first have a valid identity. You can't have an account without an identity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Azure AD account**         | An *Azure AD account* is an identity that's created through Azure AD or another Microsoft cloud service, such as Microsoft 365. Identities are stored in Azure AD and are accessible to your organization's cloud service subscriptions. The Azure AD account is also called a *work or school account*.                                                                                  |
| **Azure tenant (directory)** | An Azure *tenant* is a single dedicated and trusted instance of Azure AD. Each tenant (also called a *directory*) represents a single organization. When your organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription, a new tenant is automatically created. Because each tenant is a dedicated and trusted instance of Azure AD, you can create multiple tenants or instances. |
| **Azure subscription**       | An Azure subscription is used to pay for Azure cloud services. A subscription is linked to a credit card. Each subscription is joined to a single tenant. You can have multiple subscriptions.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### Things to consider when using AAD rather than AD DS

**Identity solution**: AD DS is primarily a directory service, while AAD is a full identity solution. AAD is designed for internet based applications that use HTTP and HTTPS

**REST API queries**: AAD is based on HTTP and HTTPS protocols meaning tenants can't be queried using LDAP

**Communication Protocols**: Because AAD is HTTP based it doesn't use kerberos (only SAML, WS-Federation, and OpenID Connect for auth - and OAuth for AuthZ)

**Federated services**: AAD includes fedeartion services and many third-party services

**Flat structure**: There are no OUs or GPOs
