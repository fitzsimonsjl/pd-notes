# Azure Resource Manager Template Advantages

### Template benefits

- Improve consistency: templates provide a common langaue for you and others to describe your deployments (regardless of tool or SDK used to deploy)

- Templates help express complex deployments. You are able to deploy multiple resources in the correct order

- Reduces risk and manual tasks. By not manually creating resources you are less likely to make errors whilst also saving time.

- Templates as code. Express requirements through code - also creating a paper trail. Can also be committed to source control such as GIT

- Templats promote re-use. The template itself can contain parameters filled when it runs e.g. username, password, or domain name. You can then have the exact same deployment across staging and production whilst keeping the same template.

- Templates are linkable. You can link Resource Manager templates together to make them modular and build them up.

- Templates simplify orchestration. You only need to deploy the template to deploy all resources.

### Azure Resource Manager Template Schema

Templates are written in JSON as key-value pairs that can be:

- a string

- a number

- a boolean expression

- a list of values

- an object (a collection of other key-value pairs)

```
{
    "$schema": "http://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "",
    "parameters": {},
    "variables": {},
    "functions": [],
    "resources": [],
    "outputs": {}
}
```

| Element name   | Required? | Description                                                                                           |
| -------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $schema        | Yes       | Location of JSON schema file that describes version of template.                                      |
| contentVersion | Yes       | Version of template (e.g. 1.0.0.0). Any value can be provided. Use it to signify significant changes. |
| parameters     | No        | Values that are provided when deployment is executed to customise resource deployment                 |
| variables      | No        | Values that are used as JSON fragments in tempalte to simplify language expressions.                  |
| functions      | No        | User-defined functions that are available within the template                                         |
| resources      | Yes       | Resource types that are deployed or updated within a resource group                                   |
| outputs        | No        | Values returned after deployment (if any)                                                             |

### Azure Resource Manager Template Parameters

In the parameters section of the template you specify which values you can input when deploying resources. The available properties for params are:

```
"parameters": {
    "<parameter-name>" : {
        "type" : "<type-of-parameter-value>",
        "defaultValue": "<default-value-of-parameter>",
        "allowedValues": [ "<array-of-allowed-values>" ],
        "minValue": <minimum-value-for-int>,
        "maxValue": <maximum-value-for-int>,
        "minLength": <minimum-length-for-string-or-array>,
        "maxLength": <maximum-length-for-string-or-array-parameters>,
        "metadata": {
        "description": "<description-of-the parameter>"
        }
    }
}
```

### Consider using Bicep Templates

Bicep is a DSL that uses declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources. Bicep redueces the complexity and improves dev experience.

- Simpler syntax - you can reference parameters and variables directly

- Modules: you can break down complex deployements into smaller module files and reference them in your main template

- Automatic dependency management: In most situations, Bicep automatically detects dependencies between resources.

- Type validation and IntelliSense: with VSCode integration
