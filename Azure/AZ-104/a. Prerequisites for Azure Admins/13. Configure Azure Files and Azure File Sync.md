# Compare storage for file shares and blob data

### Things to know about Azure Files

- Azure Files stores data as true directory objects in file shares

- Azure Files provides shared access to files across multiple virtual machines. Any number of Azure virtual machines or roles can mount and access an Azure Files storage share simultaneously

- Applications that run in Azure virtual Machines or cloud services can mount an Azure File storge share to access file data. - like a regular SMB sahre

### Things to consider when using Azure Files

- **Replacement and suplement options**: can replace traditional on-prem file servers or NAS

- **Consider global access**: Access on all OS from anywhere in the world

- **Lift and shift**: Can move applications to the cloud that are expecting a file share for user data

- **Diagnostic data**: Can be used to store diagnostics such as logs, metrics and crash dumps in a shared location

### Manage Azure File Shares

To access files, an Azure storage account is needed. When creating a file share, you need:

- To open port 445 for the SMB protocol

- Enable secure transfer (this forces HTTPS)

[See how to map an Azure File share on Windows](https://youtu.be/bmRZi9iGsK0)

### Create file share snapshots

- The Azure Files share snapshot capability is provided at the file share level

- Share snapshots are incremental - only data changed since most recent snapshot is saved

- Even though share snapshots are saved incrementally, you only need to retain teh most recent to restore the share

- You can retreive a share snapshot for an individaul file if needed

- If you want to delete a share, all snapshots must be deleted first

### Implement Azure File Sync

Azure File Sync transforms Windows Server into a quick cache of your Azure File shares. You can use any procol that is available on Windows Server to access your data locally including SMB, NFS and FTPS.

**Cloud tiering**

Is an optional feature of Azure File Sync - frequently accessed files are cached locally on the server whilst all other files are tiered to Azure files based on policy settings.

When a file is tiered, Azure File Sync replaces the file locally with a pionter (referred to as a reparse point). The reparse point represents a URL to the file in Azure Files. When a user opens a tiered file, Azure File Sync seamlessly recalls the data from Azure files without the uesr needing to know it is stored in Azure.

### Identify Azure File Sync components

There are four main componenets: 

**Storage Sync Service**

A top level resource for Azure File Sync. The Storage Sync Service forms sync relationships with multiple storage accoutns by using multiple sync groups. The service requires a distinct top-level resource from the storage account resource to support teh sync relationships. A subscription can have multiple Storage Sync Service resources deployed.

**Sync Group**

A sync group defines the sync topology for a set of files. Endpionts within a sync group are kept in sync with each other.

**Registered server**

The registered server object represents a trust relationship between your server (or cluster) and the Storage Sync Service resource.

**Azure File Sync Agent**

Is a downloadable package that allows Windows Server to be sycned with an Azure Files share

**Server endpoint**

A server endpoint represents a specific location on a registered server, such as a folder on a server volume. Multiple server endpoints can exist on the same volume if namespaces are unique.

**Cloud endpoint**

A cloud endpoint is an Azure Files share that's part of a sync group. As part of a sync group, teh entire cloud endpoint syncs. An Azure Files share can be a member of one cloud endpoint only, and one sync group only.

### Deploy Azure File Sync

1. Deploy the Storage Sync Service (defining the name, Azure subscription ID, a Resource Group, and deployment location)

2. Prepare each Windows Server to use Azure File Sync

3. Install the Azure File Sync Agent

4. Register each Windows Server with the Storage Sync Service
