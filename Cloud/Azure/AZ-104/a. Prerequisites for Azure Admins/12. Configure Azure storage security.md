# Review Azure Storage security strategies

Characteristics of Azure Storage security:

**Encyrption**: all data written to Azure storage is automaticaly encrypted

**Authentication**: AAD and RBAC are supported for Azure Storage in terms of resource management operations and data operations.

**Data in transit**: Data can be secured in transit betwen an application and Azure by using client-side encryption, HTTPS or SMB 3.0

**Disk encryption**: Operating system disk and data disks used by Azure VMs can be encrypted using Azure Disk Encryption

**Authorisation**: Every request made against a secured resource in Blob Storage, Azure files, queue storage, or Azure Cosmos DB must be authorised.

### Creating shared access signatures

A Shared access signature (SAS) is a uniform resource identifier (URI) that grants restricted access rights to Azure storage resources - in order to share them without compromising account keys. You can provide a SAS to clients who shouldn't have access to your storage account key - distributing a SAS URI instead, you grant access to a resource for a specified time frame.

**Things to know about URI definitions**

An example URI:

| **Resource URI**    | `https://myaccount.`**`blob`**`.core.windows.net/` `?restype=`**`service`** `&amp;comp=properties` | Defines the Azure Storage endpoint and other parameters. This example defines an endpoint for Blob Storage and indicates that the SAS applies to service-level operations. When the URI is used with `GET`, the Storage properties are retrieved. When the URI is used with `SET`, the Storage properties are configured. |
| **Storage version** | **`sv`**`=2015-04-05`                                                                              | For Azure Storage version 2012-02-12 and later, this parameter indicates the version to use. This example indicates that version 2015-04-05 (April 5, 2015) should be used.                                                                                                                                               |

This example sets the start time as April 29, 2015 22:18:26 UTC. If you want the SAS to be valid immediately, omit the start time.                                                                                                                           |

The signature is computed over a string-to-sign with a key by using the SHA256 algorithm, and encoded by using Base64 encoding.                                                                                                        |

### Determine Azure Storage encryption

Azure storage encryption for data at rest protects your data by ensuring org security and compliance commitments are met. Encryption and decryption process happens automatically.

- Data is automatically encrypted before it's persisted to Azure Managed Disks, Blob Storage, Queue Storage, Cosmos DB or Files - and automatically decrypted when retreived

- Azure Storage encryption, encryption at rest, and key management are transparent to users

- All data written to Azure Storage is encrypted through 256-AES - it is enabled for all new and existing storage accounts and cannot be disabled

### Configure Azure Storage encryption

This is done via the Azure Portal - you can specify the type of encryption you'd like to use, as well as manage the keys yourself, or let Microsoft take care of it.

### Creating customer managed keys

For managing keys, you can use Azure Key Vault, but there are some things to be aware of:

- By creating your own keys you have more flexibility and control

- You can create, disable, audit, rotate, and define access controls for your encryption keys

- Customer managed keys can be used with Azure Storage subscription. The key vault and storage account must be in the same region, though they can be in different subscriptions

### Apply Azure Storage security best practices

If your Shared Access Signature (SAS) is compromised, anyone who has it can use it, therefore:

- Always use HTTPS for creation and distribution

- Reference stored access policies where possible

- Set near-term expiry times for an unplanned SAS

- Require clients to automatically renew the SAS

- Plan the SAS start time

- Define minimum access permissions for resources

- Understand account billing for usage

- Validate data written by using a SAS

- Don't assume a SAS is always the correct choice

- Monitor your applicaitions with Azure Storage Analytics
