### What is the Azure CLI?

The Azure CLI is a command line program to connect to Azure and execute admin comands on Azure resources. It provides cross-platform tools 

Linux: apt-get on Ubuntu, yum on REdhat or zypper on OpenSUSE

macOS: Homebrew

**Using the Azure CLI in scripts**

Azure CLI:

```powershell
variable="value"
variable=integer
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
$variable="value"
$variable=integer
```

### Working with the Azure CLI

**What Azure resources can be managed using the Azure CLI?**

You can control nearly every aspect of every Azure resource. Commands in the CLI are structured in groups and subgroups. For example, the storage group contains subgroups including account, blob, and queue.

You can find the commands you need by using az find e.g,:

```powershell
az find blob # Will show all commands that contain the subgroup blob...
```

If you already know the command you need, but you aren't sure how to use it:

```powershell
az storage blob --help
```

**Connect**

```powershell
az login 
```

**Create**

```powershell
az group create --name <name> --location <location>
```

**Verify**

```powershell
az group list # or for a more concise view:
az group list --output table 
```
