### Azure Resource Manager benefits

**Consistent Management layer**

Azure Resources Manager allows you to work with resources as a group - you can deploy, update, or delete all ersources in a single coordinated way. You can consistently do this via Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, Azure Portal, REST API, or Client SDKs.

**Benefits**

- You can deploy, manage, and monitor all resources together in a group rather than individually.

- You can repeatedly deploy your solution throughout the dev lifecycle consistently

- You can manage infra via declarative templates instead of scripts

- You can define dependencies between resources so they're deployed in the correct order

- You can apply access control to all services in a resource group with RBAC integration

- You can apply tags to organise resources in a subscription

- You can clarify billing by viewing costs for a group of resources that share the same tag

**Guidance**

The following will help you take full advantage of Azure Resource Manager:

- Define and deploy infra through declarative syntax in Azure Resource Manager templates rather than imperative commands

- Define all deployment and config steps in the template so there is nothing manual to do

- Run imperative commands to manage resources (e.g. start or stop app/machine)

- Arrange resources with the same lifecycle in a resource group. Use tags for organising.

### Review Azure Resource Terminology

**Resource**: A manageable item available through Azure. Some common resources are a virtual machine, storage account, web app, database, or virtual network.

**Resource group**: A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution - it can include all resources for a solution or only specific ones. Entirely up to you.

**Resource provider**: A service that supplies resources you can deploy and manage through Resource Manager

**Template**: A JSON file that defines one or more resources to deploy to a resource group. IT also defines dependencies between the deployed respources. The template allows them to be deployed consistently and repeatedly.

**Declarative syntax**: Lets you state "Here is what I intend to create" without having to write the commands to create it.

### Create Resource Groups

**Considerations**

There are a few considerations to bear in mind:

- Resources can only exist in one resource group

- Resource Groups cannot be renamed

- Resource Groups can have resources of many different types (services)

- Resource Groups can have resources from many different regions

**Creating Resource Groups**

- All resources in your group should share the same lifecycle. You deploy, update, and delete them together. If one resource (e.g. a DB server) needs to exist on a different cycle it should be in a separate resource group.

- Each resource can only exist in one group

- You can add or remove a resource to a group at any time

- You can add or remove a resource from one group to another

- A resource group can contain resources in different regions

- A resource group can be used to scope access control for admin actions

- A resource group can interact with resources in other groups. This is common when two resources are related but do not share the same lifecycle.

When creating a resource group you need to specify a location for that group. This is for compliance reasons on where the metadata gets stored.

### Create Azure Resource Manager locks

A common concern with provisioned resources is how easily they can be deleted. Locking resources means they do not get deleted accidentally.

Locks can be associated with a subscription, resource group, or a specific resource - and locks are inherited by child resources. The two types are read-only (prevent changes), and delete (prevents deletion).

**! Only the Owner and User Access Admin roles can create or delete management locks !**

### Reorganise Azure Resources

Ocassionally you might need to move resources to a new subscription or a new resource group in the same subscription. When doing this move, both source and target group are locked during the operation. It means you cannot add, update, or delte resources.

**Limitations**

[Move operation support by resource type - Azure Resource Manager | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-support-resources) outlines the process and whato go over before the move.

**Implementation**

Select the resource group containing resources you wantr to move and then select the "Move" button and pick a destination.

### Remove Resources and resource groups

You can either use the GUI, or PowerShell:

```
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "ContosoRG01"
```

### Determining Resource Limits

Azure lets you view resource usage against limits. The limits show are limits for your subscription - when you need to increase a limit there is a link to do so. All resources hve a maximimum listed limit which you can find [here]([Azure subscription limits and quotas - Azure Resource Manager | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits?toc=%2fazure%2fnetworking%2ftoc.json)). If you are the maximium limit, it cannot be increased.
