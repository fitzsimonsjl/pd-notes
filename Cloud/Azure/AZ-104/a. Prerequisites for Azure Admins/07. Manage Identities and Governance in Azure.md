### Create user accounts

**Things to know about user accounts**

The table below describes user account types supported by AAD:

| User account                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cloud identity**                  | A user account with a *cloud identity* is defined only in Azure AD. This type of user account includes administrator accounts and users who are managed as part of your organization. A cloud identity can be for user accounts defined in your Azure AD organization, and also for user accounts defined in an external Azure AD instance. When a cloud identity is removed from the primary directory, the user account is deleted. |
| **Directory-synchronized identity** | User accounts that have a *directory-synchronized identity* are defined in an on-premises Active Directory. A synchronization activity occurs via Azure AD Connect to bring these user accounts in to Azure. The source for these accounts is Windows Server Active Directory.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Guest user**                      | *Guest user* accounts are defined outside Azure. Examples include user accounts from other cloud providers, and Microsoft accounts like an Xbox LIVE account. The source for guest user accounts is Invited user. Guest user accounts are useful when external vendors or contractors need access to your Azure resources.                                                                                                            |

**Things to consider when choosing user accounts**

- Consider where users are defined - are all users defined within AAD, or are some defined in external AAD instances? Do you have users external to your organisation?

- Consider support for external contributors. Allow external contributors to access Azure resources in your org by supporting guest account types.

- Consider a combination of accounts. Implement the user account types that enable your org to meet their business requirements.

### Manage User Accounts

- A new user account must have a display name and an assoiciated user account name.

- Information and settings that describe the user are stored in the account profile

- The profile can have other settings such as the users job title, and their contact email

- A user with global admin or user admin privileges can preset profile data in user accounts

- Non-admins can set their own profile data but can't change display or account name.

### Create bulk users

- Can be found under "Bulk operations"

- Only global admins and user admins have privileges to create and delete user accounts in the Azure portal

- Fill out a bulk user operation by the csv template

### Create group accounts

There are two types of groups you can create accounts for:

**Security**: manage member and computer access to specific resources for a group of users. It can be a group for a specific policy that gives users in that group the same permissions.

**Microsoft 365**: provide a way to collaborate - group members have access to a shared mailbox, calendar, files, sharepoint site

**Things to consider when adding group members**

| Access rights      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Assigned**       | Add specific users as members of a group, where each user can have unique permissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Dynamic user**   | Use dynamic membership rules to automatically add and remove group members. When member attributes change, Azure reviews the dynamic group rules for the directory. If the member attributes meet the rule requirements, the member is added to the group. If the member attributes no longer meet the rule requirements, the member is removed.                                             |
| **Dynamic device** | (*Security groups only*) Apply dynamic group rules to automatically add and remove devices in security groups. When device attributes change, Azure reviews the dynamic group rules for the directory. If the device attributes meet the rule requirements, the device is added to the security group. If the device attributes no longer meet the rule requirements, the device is removed. |

### Create Administrative Units

As you design your strategy for managing identities and governance in Azure, planning for comprehensive management of your AAD is critical e.g. a large busienss with many divisions, or a university with many departments.

**Things to consider when working with administrative units**

- Consider management tools. Review options - you can use the Azure Portal, Powershell, or MS Graph

- Consider role requirements in Azure portal. Plan strategy for administrative units according to role privileges

- Consider scope of administrative units. Recognise the scope of an administrative unit applies only to management permissions. Members and admins for an administrative unit can exercise their default permissions to browse other users, groups, and resources outside of their own administrative unit.

### Configure subscriptions

**Identify Azure regions**

- Azure is generally available in more than 140 countries/regions

- Regions provide you with the flexibility and scale needed to bring your applications closer to your users

- Regions preserve data residency and offer comprehensive compliance and resiliency options for customers

**Things to know about regional pairs**

Most Azure regions are paired with another region of the same geography to make a _regional pair_. These help support the availability of Azure resources used by your infra.

| Characteristic                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Physical isolation**            | Azure prefers at least 300 miles of separation between datacenters in a regional pair. This principle isn't practical or possible in all geographies. Physical datacenter separation reduces the likelihood of natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages affecting both regions at once. |
| **Platform-provided replication** | Some services like Geo-Redundant Storage provide automatic replication to the paired region.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Region recovery order**         | During a broad outage, recovery of one region is prioritized out of every pair. Applications that are deployed across paired regions are guaranteed to have one of the regions recovered with priority.                                                                                                                    |
| **Sequential updates**            | Planned Azure system updates are rolled out to paired regions sequentially (not at the same time). Rolling updates minimizes downtime, reduces bugs, and logical failures in the rare event of a bad update.                                                                                                               |
| **Data residency**                | Regions reside within the same geography as their enabled set (except for the Brazil South and Singapore regions).                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

**Implement Azure subscriptions**

An Azure subscription is a logical unit of Azure services that's linked to an Azure account. Subscriptions help organise access to Azure cloud service resources and control how resource usage is reported, billed, and paid.

**Things to know about subscriptions**

- Every Azure cloud service belongs to a subscription

- Each subscription can have a different billing and payment configuration

- Multiple subscriptions  can be linked to same Azure account

- More than one Azure account can be linked to the same subscription

You can obtain an Azure subscription via the following methods:

- Enterprise agreement
- Microsoft Reseller
- Microsoft partner
- Personal free account

### Implement Microsoft Cost Management

With Azure products and services you only pay what you use. As you create and use Azure resources, you're charged for them. Microsoft Cost Management provides support for administrative billing tasks and helps you manage billing access to costs.

### Apply resource tagging

You can apply tags to your Azure resources to logically organise them by categories. Each tag resource consists of a name and a value.

**Things to know about resource tags**

As you plan your Azure subscriptions, reousrces, and services, bear these in mind:

- Each resource tag has a name and value
- The tag name remains constant for all resources that have the tag applied
- The tag value can be selected from a defined set of values, or unique for a specific resource instance
- A resource or resource group can have a maximum of 50 tag name/value pairs
- Tags applied to a resource group aren't inherited by the resources in the resource group

### Apply cost savings

| Cost saving               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reservations**          | Save money by paying ahead. You can pay for one year or three years of virtual machine, SQL Database compute capacity, Azure Cosmos DB throughput, or other Azure resources. Pre-paying allows you to get a discount on the resources you use. Reservations can significantly reduce your virtual machine, SQL database compute, Azure Cosmos DB, or other resource costs up to 72% on pay-as-you-go prices. Reservations provide a billing discount and don't affect the runtime state of your resources. |
| **Azure Hybrid Benefits** | Access pricing benefits if you have a license that includes *Software Assurance*. Azure Hybrid Benefits helps maximize the value of existing on-premises Windows Server or SQL Server license investments when migrating to Azure. There's an Azure Hybrid Benefit Savings Calculator to help you determine your savings.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Azure Credits**         | Use the monthly credit benefit to develop, test, and experiment with new solutions on Azure. As a Visual Studio subscriber, you could use Microsoft Azure at no extra charge. With your monthly Azure credit, Azure is your personal sandbox for development and testing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Azure regions**         | Compare pricing across regions. Pricing can vary from one region to another, even in the US. Double check the pricing in various regions to see if you can save by selecting a different region for your subscription.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Budgets**               | Apply the budgeting features in Microsoft Cost Management to help plan and drive organizational accountability. With budgets, you can account for the Azure services you consume or subscribe to during a specific period. Monitor spending over time and inform others about their spending to proactively manage costs. Use budgets to compare and track spending as you analyze costs.                                                                                                                  |
| **Pricing Calculator**    | The [Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) provides estimates in all areas of Azure, including compute, networking, storage, web, and databases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### Configure Azure Policy

**Create Management Groups**

Azure Management groups have the following characteristics:

- By default, all new subscriptions are placed under the top-level management group (or root group)

- All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to that management group

- A management group tree can support up to 6 levels of depth

- Azure RBAC authorisation for management group operations isn't enabled by default

**Implement Azure policies**

Azure Policy is a service in Azure that you can use to create, assign and manage policies. You can use policies to enforce rules on your resources to meet corporate compliance standards and SLAs.

**Things to know about Azure Policy**

**Enforce rules and compliance**: Enable built-in policies or build custom policies for all your resource types. Support real time policy evaluation and enforcement and periodic or on demand compliance evaluation

**Apply policies at scale**: Apply policies to a management group with control across the entire org - can also define an exclusion scope

**Perform remediation**: Conduct real-time remediation and remediation on your existing resources

**Exercise governance**: Implement governance tasks for your environment -

- Support multiple engineering teams

- Manage multiple subscriptions

- Standardise and enforce how cloud resources are configured

- Manage regulatory compliance, cost control, security, and design consistency

### Create Azure policies

1. Create Policy definitions

A policy definition expresses a condition to evaluate and the actions to perform when the condition is met. You can create your own policy definitions or choose from built-in definitions in Azure Policy.

2. Create an initiative definition

An initiative definition is a set of policy definitions that help you track your resource compliance state to meet a larger goal. You can create your own initiatie definitions, or use the bulit-in ones. 

3. Scope the initiative definition

Azure Policy lets you control how your initiative definitions are applied to resources in your org. You can limit the scope of an initiative definition to specific management groups, subscriptions, or resource groups.

4. Determine compliance

After you assign an initiative definition, you can evaluate the state of compliance for all your resources. Individual resources, resource groups, and subscriptions within a scope can be exempted from having the policy rules affect it. Exclusions are handled individually for each assignment.

### Implement role-based access control

RBAC is a mechanism to help manage who can access your Azure reources. RBAC lets you determine what operations specific users can do on specific resources. RBAC is an authorisation system bulit on Azure Resource Manager.

Some things you can do with Azure RBAC:

- Allow an application to access all resources in a resource group

- Allow one user to manage VMs in a subscription, and another user to manage virtual networks

- Allow a DBA group to manage SQL databases in a subscription

- Allow a uesr to manage all resources in a resource group.

RBAC Core Concepts:

| Concept                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Examples                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Security principal** | An object that represents something that requests access to resources.                                                                                                                                                | User, group, service principal, managed identity                                                                                                                   |
| **Role definition**    | A set of permissions that lists the allowed operations. Azure RBAC comes with built-in role definitions, but you can also create your own custom role definitions.                                                    | Some built-in role definitions: *Reader*, *Contributor*, *Owner*, *User Access Administrator*                                                                      |
| **Scope**              | The boundary for the requested *level* of access, or "how much" access is granted.                                                                                                                                    | Root, management group, subscription, resource group, resource                                                                                                     |
| **Assignment**         | An **assignment** attaches a **role definition** to a **security principal** at a particular **scope**. Users can grant the access described in a role definition by creating (attaching) an assignment for the role. | - Assign the *User Access Administrator* role to an admin group scoped to a management group<br>- Assign the *Contributor* role to a user scoped to a subscription |

### Create a role definition

A role definition consists of sets of permissions that are defined in a JSON file. Each permission set has a name such as Actions or NotActions describing the purpose of the permission. Some example permission sets:

- Actions permissions identify what actions are allowed

- NotActions permissions specify what actions aren't allowed

- DataActions permissions indicate how data can be changed or used

- AssignableScopes permissions list the scopes where a role definition can be assigned

Role definition in PowerShell:

```powershell
Name: Owner
ID: 01010101-2323-4545-6767-987453021523
IsCustom: False
Description: Manage everything, including access to resources
Actions: {*}             # All actions allowed
NotActions: {}           # No actions denied
AssignableScopes: {/}    # Role can be assigned to all scopes
```

### Role Permissions

Use the Actions and NotActions permissions together to grant and deny the exact privileges for each role (the Actions permissions can provide the bredth of access, and the NotActions permissions can narrow the access). 

The below table shows how they are used in the definitions for three built-in roles: Owner, Contributer, Reader.

| Role name     | Description                                               | Actions permissions | NotActions permissions                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Owner*       | Allow all actions                                         | `*`                 | n/a                                                                                                                             |
| *Contributor* | Allow all actions, except write or delete role assignment | `*`                 | - `Microsoft.Authorization/*/Delete`<br>- `Microsoft.Authorization/*/Write`<br>- `Microsoft.Authorization/elevateAccess/Action` |
| *Reader*      | Allow all read actions                                    | `/*/read`           | n/a                                                                                                                             |

### Role Scopes

After you define the role permissions you use the AssignableScopes permissions to specify how the role can be assigned e.g to scope a role as avaialble for assignment in two subscriptions:

```powershell
"/subscriptions/c276fc76-9cd4-44c9-99a7-4fd71546436e", "/subscriptions/e91d47c4-76f3-4271-a796-21b4ecfe3624"
```

To scope a role as available for assignment only in the Network resource group:

```powershell
"/subscriptions/c276fc76-9cd4-44c9-99a7-4fd71546436e/resourceGroups/Network"
```

### Create a role assignment

Role assignments have the following characteristics:

- The purpose of role assignment is to control access.

- The scope limits which permissions defined for a role are available for the assigned requestor

- Access is revoked by removing a role assignment

- A resource inherits role assignments from its parent resource

### Compare Azure roles to AAD roles

There are three types of roles available for acces management in Azure:

- Classic subscription administrator roles

- Azure RBAC roles

- AAD admin roles

| Role definitions  | Roles can be defined via the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Azure Resource Manager templates, and the REST API | Roles can be defined via the Azure admin portal, Microsoft 365 admin portal, and Microsoft Graph Azure AD PowerShell |

### Apply role-based access control

Built-in role definitions in Azure RBAC are defined for several categories of services tasks, and users. You can assign built-in roles at different scopes to support various scenarios.

AAD also provides built-in roles ot manage resources in AAD including users, groups, and domains.

- **AAD Admin roles** are used to manage resources in AAD such as users, groups, and domains. These roles are defined for the AAD tenant at the root level of the config.

- Azure RBAC roles provide more granular access management for Azure resources. These roles are defined for a requestor or resource and can be applied at multliple levels: root, management groups, subscriptions, resources groups, or resources.

# Create Azure users and groups in AAD

### What are user accounts in AAD?

In AAD, all user accounts are granted a set of default permissions. A user's account access consists of the type of user, their role assignments, and their ownership of individual objects.

### Permissions and roles

AAD uses permissions to help you control access rights a user or group is granted. This is done through roles - of which AAD has many with different permissions attached. Understanding when to assign the correct type of role is curcial in maintaining security and compliance.

### Adminstrator roles

Allow elevated access to control who can dao what - assign these roles to a limited group fo users to manage identity tasks in your AAD org.

### Member users

A member user account is a native member of the AAD org that has a default set of permissions like being able to manage their own profile information. However, they should not be able to do things such as manage otehrs e.g. creaeting or deleting users.

### Guest users

Have restricted organisation permissions. When you invite someone to collaborate with your organisation, you can ad them to your AAD as a guest user. By default, AAD members can invite guest users (this can be disabled by an Admin)
