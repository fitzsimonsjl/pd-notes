### Resource governance capabilities in Azure

**Azure Policy**

Designed to help enforce standards and asssess compliance across your organisation. Through the compliance dashboard you can access an aggregated view to help evaluate the overall state of the env. 

Azure policy evaluates all resources in Azure and Arc enabled resources. Business rules are described using JSON and referred to as policy definitions.

**Evaluation Outcomes**

Azure Policy evaluates resources at specific times during the resource lifecycle and policy assignment lifecycle. Following events or times will trigger evaluation:

- A resource is created, deleted, or updated in scope with policy assignment

- A policy or intiative is newly assigned to a scope

- A policy or initiative that's been assigned to a scope is updated

- The standard compliance eval cycle (every 24 hours)

### Difference between Azure Policy & Azure RBAC

Azure policy ensures a resource state is compliant to business rules. 

Azure RBAC focuses on managing user actions at different scopes.

The two should be used together for full scope in Azure.

### Azure Blueprints

A way to define a repeatable set of Azure resources. Can orchestrate the deployment of various resource templates and other artifacts like:

- Role assignments

- Policy assignments

- Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates)

- Resource Groups

Blueprint objects are replicated to multiple Azure regions, providing low latency, HA and consistent access.
