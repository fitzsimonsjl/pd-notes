### Know, Protect & Govern your data

MS Purview Information Protection discovers, classifies, and protects sensitive and busines critical content throughout its lifecycle across the org. (import, store, classify).

- Know your data - orgs can understand their data landscape and identify important data across on-prem, cloud, and hybrid envs (trainable classifiers, activity explorer, content exporer)

- Protect your data - orgs can apply flexible protection actions (encryption, access restrictions, visual markings)

- Prevent data loss - orgs can detect risky behaviour and prevent accidental oversharing of sensitive info (data loss prevention policies, endpoint data loss prevention)

- Govern your data - Orgs can automatically keep, delte and store data in a compliant manner (retention policies, retention labels, records management)

### Data classification capabilties of compliance portal

MS Purview provides 3 ways of identifying items to be classified:

- manually by users

- automated pattern recognition (sensitive information types)

- machine learning

### Sensitive Information Types (SIT)

Pattern based classifiers. Purview has many built in:

- Credit card numbers

- Passport or identification numbers

- Bank account numbers

- Health service numbers

### Trainable classifiers

AI & ML that classify org data. Two types available:

- Pre-trained (MS has created and trained them so you can use them immediately)

- Custom trainable (contracts, invoices, customer records) 

! only works with items that are not encrypted !

### Sensitivity labels and policies

Enable labling and protection of content without affecting productivity or collaboration. 

Labels are: 

**Customisable**: Admins can create different categories specific to org e.g. Personal, Public, Confidential, Highly Confidential

**Clear text**: Because each label is stored in clear text in metadata, third party apps can apply own protective actions if necessary

**Persistent**: After applying label, it is stored in emtadate of email or ducment (which moves with content, including protection settings)

**Each item supporting sensitivity labels can only have one label applied at a time!**

Sensitivity labels can be configured to:

- Encrypt

- Mark content (e.g. watermarks, headers or footers)

- Apply label automatically

- Protect content in containers such as sites and groups

- Extend sensitivity labels to third party apps and services

- Classify content without using any protection settings

After sensitivity labels are created, they need to be published to make them available to people and services in the org - published to users or groups through label policies. These allow admins to:

- Choose users and groups that can see labels

- Apply a default label (users can change label if they think there is a more appropriate one)

- Require justification for label changes

- Require users to apply a label (mandatory labelling)

- Link users to custom help pages

### Data loss prevention

MS Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is a way to protect sensitive info and prevent inadvertant disclosure. With DLP policies admins can:

- Identify, monitor, and protect sensitive information across M365 (OneDrive for Business, SharePoint Online, MS Teams, Exchange Online)

- Help users learn how compliance works without interrupting workfrlow.

- View DLP reports

DLP policies enforce rules that conssit of:

- Conditions that the content has to match before rule is enforced

- Actions that the admin wants the rule to take automatically when it matches a condition

- Locations wehre the policy will apply (e.g. Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive)

### Endpoint data loss prevention

Endpoint DLP extens activity monitoring of DLP to items physically stored on Win 10, 11 and MacOS (Catalina 10.15+). It can audit activities users do such as:

- Creating an item

- Renaming an item

- Copying items to removable media

- Copying items to network shares

- Printing documents

- Accessing items using unallowed apps and browsers

Also extends to MS Teams (so users cannot share sensitive info via chat and channel messages)

### Retention Policies and retention labels

Helps orgs manage and govern info by ensuring it is only kept for a require time, then permanently deleted. This can:

- Comply proactively with industry regulations and policies

- Reduce risk when there's litigation or a security breach

- Ensure users only work with content that is current and relevant to them

**Policies**

Are used to assign the same retention settings to content at a site or mailbox level. A single policy can be applied to multiple locations (or specific locations and users). Items inherit the retention settings from their container specified in retention policy.

**Labels**

Are used to assign retention settings at an item level (folder, doc, email). Retention settings move with document/content. Admins can enable users to apply label manually. A label can be applied automatically if certain conditions are met.

### Records management

Orgs of all types require a management solution to manage regulatory, legal, and business critical records across corp data. It also helps to demonstrate compliance. MS Purview Records Management includes:

- Labeling content as record

- Establishing retention and deletion policies within record label

- Triggering event-based retention

- Reeviewing and validating disposition

- Proof of records deletion

- Exporting information about disposed items

### Common use cases for records management

- Enabling admins and users to manually apply retention and deletion actions for docs and emails

- Automatically applying retention and deleting actions for docs and emails

- Enable sit admins to set default retain and delte actions for all content in a Sharepoint library, folder, or doc set

- Enable users to automatically apply retain and delete actions to emails using Outlook rules
